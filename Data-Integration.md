# Considerations

- Watch for and avoid unnecessary data replication.
- Use Salesforce Connect instead of Salesforce to Salesforce, which is EOL.
- Salesforce will not make further investments in enhancing outbound messages.
- What system is the source of truth?
- What teams are responsible for maintaining the integration? Is it maintainable?
- Does the integration involve large data volumes (LDV)?  Will changes happen in bulk?
- Limits: how many interactions, how much API usage, data, etc.?
